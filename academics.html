                    <p>The idea to establish the School of Economics and Administrative Sciences started in early July 2023 under the theme: <em>"Normal expansion process of St. Mary's University College."</em></p>
                    <p>The Senate Board and experts completed initial curriculum work in 2024. Associate Professor <strong>Dr. Roden Loro Karlo</strong> was appointed to lead the school as Dean from September 1, 2025. Validation of the curriculum by technical experts was completed in October 2025.</p>
                    <p><strong>The school is optimistic that it will hopefully start the first intake in early 2026</strong> prior to the approval of Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research authorities.</p>
